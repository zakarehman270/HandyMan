					Carpenters participate in a variety of construction projects, from the
					construction of highways and bridges to the installation of home
					cabinets. Each carpentry task is unique, but most require the same
					fundamental stages. In compliance with local building codes,
					carpenters first perform the layout, which includes measuring,
					marking, and arranging materials using blueprints or supervisory
					instructions. Using manual and power equipment such as chisels,
					planes, saws, drills, and sanders, they cut and shape wood, plastic,
					fiberglass, or drywall. The materials are subsequently joined with
					nails, screws, staples, or adhesives. In the last step, carpenters use
					levels, rules, plumb bobs, framing squares, and surveying equipment to
					evaluate the accuracy of their work and make any necessary revisions.
					Some materials are prefabricated, making installation easier and
					quicker. Carpenters may perform a variety of carpentry skills, or they
					may choose to specialize in one or two tasks. For example, carpenters
					who remodel homes and other structures require a wide range of
					carpentry skills. As part of a single project, they may frame walls
					and partitions, install doors and windows, construct stairs, install
					cabinets and trim, and do several other activities. Well-trained
					carpenters are able to convert from home construction to commercial
					construction or renovation work, based on the employment prospects
					available.

				<h1 className="mt-3 mb-3">What does carpenters do and for whom?</h1>
				<p>
					Carpenters who work for large construction contractors or specialty
					contractors may simply do a few routine tasks, such as building wooden
					forms for pouring concrete and erecting scaffolding. Some carpenters
					construct tunnel bracing or brattices in subterranean passages and
					mines to regulate the flow of air to and from work locations. Others
					make concrete forms for use in tunnel, bridge, and sewage
					construction. Outside of the construction industry, carpenters do a
					number of installation, fixing and maintenance tasks. In addition to
					replacing windows, ceiling tiles, and doors, they may also repair
					desks, cabinets, and other furniture. Depending on the employer,
					carpenters install partitions, doors, and windows, replace locks, and
					repair damaged furniture. In manufacturing companies, carpenters may
					aid in the relocation or installation of machinery. We hope that you
