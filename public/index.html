			content="Let’s talk about what does carpenters do? Well they are the folks that construct, erect, install, and repair wooden and non-wooden structures and fittings. Carpenters participate in a variety of construction projects, from the construction of highways and bridges to the installation of home cabinets.
      Each carpentry task is unique, but most require the same fundamental stages. In compliance with local building codes, carpenters first perform the layout, which includes measuring, marking, and arranging materials using blueprints or supervisory instructions. Using manual and power equipment such as chisels, planes, saws, drills, and sanders, they cut and shape wood, plastic, fiberglass, or drywall. The materials are subsequently joined with nails, screws, staples, or adhesives. In the last step, carpenters use levels, rules, plumb bobs, framing squares, and surveying equipment to evaluate the accuracy of their work and make any necessary revisions. Some materials are prefabricated, making installation easier and quicker.
      Carpenters may perform a variety of carpentry skills, or they may choose to specialize in one or two tasks. For example, carpenters who remodel homes and other structures require a wide range of carpentry skills. As part of a single project, they may frame walls and partitions, install doors and windows, construct stairs, install cabinets and trim, and do several other activities. Well-trained carpenters are able to convert from home construction to commercial construction or renovation work, based on the employment prospects available.
